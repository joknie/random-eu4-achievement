# random-eu4-achievement
A quick and dirty script offering the user a random unobtained EU4 achievement to play for

## Usage

On the line with the curl command, replace the XXXXX in the URL with your generated Steam Web API key and the target account's SteamID. (Note: Steam account needs to be public) 

The App ID could also be changed to use this little script for other games.

Make the script executable and run it, but you probably knew that part anyway.

## Possible Extensions (if I ever bother to come back to this)

* Adding command line parameters to override App ID and Steam ID or to output any number of unobtained achievements (or even all)
